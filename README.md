# honour-the-code

Welcome to our GitHub repository for our form filler program. A few things to note:
- The lambdafunctioncode.py is just the python code used by the lambda function and should not be run by the IDE.
- Since we are using AWS to run the program, access keys to an IAM user is needed so that the program can access the S3 bucket that stores the files. In this file (FormFiller.py) you will see that those lines of code have been left blank for security reasons. This means that the program will not run as intended if you do not have access to the access keys.
    - Contact us for the access keys if you wish to run this program for yourself.
